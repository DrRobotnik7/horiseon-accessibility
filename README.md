# Horiseon website with accessibility improvements

## Description

Horiseon is a marketing agency that has requested a refactor of their website's codebase so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines.

This is important because:

- It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
- Accessibility boosts search engine optimisation. Accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google.
- Mitigates against potential future litigation in the event that people with disabilities cannot access the website.
